A treasure hunt game for the Raspberry Pi version of MineCraft.  It uses Meltwater's multi-colour LEDs to show proximity to the treasure chest.  More lights light up the nearer you are and the next light blinks with increasing frequency to give you even more of a clue as to how you're doing.  The treasure is a chest.  Hacking the chest apart reveals a diamond block and the game then displays your time to complete.
